          {
              "question": "How does this plugin speed up my site?",
              "answer": "It optimizes your site's loading speed by leveraging advanced caching mechanisms, minimizing server requests, and optimizing the delivery of static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files. Additionally, RapidLoad utilizes techniques like lazy loading, which defers the loading of non-critical elements until they are needed, further enhancing the overall speed and efficiency of your site. Smaller files = faster sites!"

              "answer": "There is a possibility the page can be broken with RapidLoad as it does the removal automatically. you can easily fix broken elements with safelist rules. we recommend to turn on \"Load Original CSS files\" and add safelist rules. if you are not sure how to add safelist rules create a support ticket in [https://rapidload.zendesk.com/hc/en-us](https://rapidload.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) one of our support member will help you out ."

              "question": "How is this plugin different from CriticalCSS?",
