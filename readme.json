        },
        {
          "question": "How does this plugin speed up my site?",
          "answer": "It optimizes your site's loading speed by leveraging advanced caching mechanisms, minimizing server requests, and optimizing the delivery of static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files. Additionally, RapidLoad utilizes techniques like lazy loading, which defers the loading of non-critical elements until they are needed, further enhancing the overall speed and efficiency of your site. Smaller files = faster sites!"
        },
        {
          "question": "My Site is broken after using RapidLoad. What can i do ?",
          "answer": "There is a possibility the page can be broken with RapidLoad as it does the removal automatically. you can easily fix broken elements with safelist rules. we recommend to turn on \"Load Original CSS files\" and add safelist rules. if you are not sure how to add safelist rules create a support ticket in <a href=\"https://rapidload.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\">https://rapidload.zendesk.com/hc/en-us</a> one of our support member will help you out ."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need to run this every time I make a change?",
          "answer": "No! RapidLoad works in the background, so any new stylesheets that are added will be analyzed and optimized on the fly. Just set it and forget it!"

        {
          "question": "Will this plugin work with Woocommerce?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How is this plugin different from CriticalCSS?",
          "answer": "RapidLoad looks for CSS that is not being applied at all and stops it from being loaded. CriticalCSS looks for CSS that needs to be applied when the page begins loading and reorders it based on priority."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do exclusions work?",
          "answer": "RapidLoad accepts both broad and star(*) expressions and regular expression exclusions of CSS selectors. You can add your exclusions in the unused CSS tab of the Autoptimize plugin settings."
